Lexical Analyzer of C Code in Java

This project is a lexical analyzer of C code written in Java. The input is a piece of C code written in a text file named input11.txt. The Java code reads the file, dissects it into lexemes using if statements and use cases, and then categorizes each lexeme into a token.

To run the lexical analyzer, you will need to have Java installed on your computer.

The lexical analyzer is a useful tool for understanding and debugging C code. It can also be used to improve the readability of C code by identifying and grouping related tokens
